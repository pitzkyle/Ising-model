# Ising-model

The Ising model describes a basic ferromagnet, in which a lattice of atomic spins have two states (up or down). Each spin can interact with only its nearest-neighbor spins, and preferentially aligns neighboring spins to reduce the system's energy, unless thermally disturbed. 

The 2D Ising simulation is a very basic view of a statistical mechanical system, but can lead to several important physical results. Phase transitions can be observed between ordered and disordered states, among other system characteristics such as magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. One can also apply a non-zero external magnetic field to the system to analyze the effect of this.
